# React Native FlatList Rendering Issue

This repository demonstrates a bug where a FlatList component in React Native intermittently fails to render data correctly after fetching data from an API.  The issue is not consistently reproducible, making debugging challenging.  The provided solution offers a potential fix for this intermittent behavior.

## Bug Description
The FlatList component often displays an empty list, even when the API call is successful and data is properly retrieved.  The problem appears to be related to data updates and state management within the component lifecycle.
